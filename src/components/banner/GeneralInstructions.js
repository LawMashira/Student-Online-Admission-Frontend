How To Make The Most Out Of Campus Life
Part of the university experience is building a social circle. The friends you make at university could well end up being friends for life. The following tips can help you connect with your fellow students:

Participate in orientation activities and events – it’s the best way to meet new people.
Join clubs and societies that interest you. Whether it be sports or outreach, it will bring you face to face with like-minded people.
Be open and approachable. Smile, introduce yourself, and be open to forming connections with people from different backgrounds.
Balancing Social Life With Academics
Making friends is important, but not at the expense of your academics. It’s important to find the right balance between socialising and studying. Here's how:

Create a schedule: Allocate specific time slots for both academic and social activities.
Set boundaries: Learn to say no when necessary. Don't let social activities interfere with your studies.
Take care of yourself: To maintain that healthy balance, make sure you get enough sleep, exercise and relaxation.
Financial Planning Tips For University
University life comes with its own set of financial challenges so you need to learn to budget effectively:

Creating a budget is your first step to financial well-being. Outline your monthly expenses, including accommodation, food, entertainment and personal needs.
Don’t spend unnecessarily. Keep your eye on what you spend your money on. It may be difficult to have to miss that expensive concert, but you need to stay within your budget.
Have an emergency fund. If you can, save a little every month to help you cope when those unexpected expenses arise.
Take time to find out what scholarships, bursaries or financial aid might be on offer. The SA government provides financial aid through the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) for students who struggle to pay fees.
Part-time work can provide extra income, practical experience, and networking opportunities. But before you rush off looking for part-time work think about issues such as the impact it may have on your academic performance, and that it can increase stress.
How To Manage Your Mental Health And Wellbeing
University life can be demanding, and your mental health and well-being is a priority. Recognise the signs of stress, anxiety, and burnout. These can include irritability, loss of interest and avoiding friends and family. Don’t hesitate to get professional support. Many universities offer counselling services specifically for this purpose. Asking for support is a sign of strength, not weakness. Techniques that can help you manage your stress include mindfulness (which helps you stay in the present and reduces anxiety), meditation, and regular exercise.

Practical Preparation

If you are taking the huge step of moving into student digs, make sure you are moving to a safe area and that there are safety features (an alarm, burglar guards) at the accommodation you select. Meet your potential housemates before making a decision. Communicate and behave thoughtfully to keep a calm and happy atmosphere in your new home.

Attend Orientation Week
Orientation week is your first introduction to university life. At Varsity College, for instance, you can expect campus tours, which will help you find your way about the campus. Information sessions help you learn about academic programmes, campus policies and support services. Of course, there are plenty of social events that are not only fun but a great way to meet new people.

For many people, the busy student years can be one of the most rewarding but also challenging periods of their lives. Being properly prepared and knowing what to expect from the start will go a long way in making the journey easier and more enriching.
